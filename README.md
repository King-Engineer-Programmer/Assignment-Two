Programming With Python
For this module’s assignment, you’ll use Python to import a comma-separated values (CSV) file that contains S&P 500 stock data from 2016 to 2020. This type of data is known as time series data. Time series data covers a set interval of time and is commonly used in finance and product development jobs. After importing the data, you’ll determine the day that had the greatest daily percentage change, the percentage change that occurred on that day, the high and low stock prices for that day, and the total volume of trading for that day.
